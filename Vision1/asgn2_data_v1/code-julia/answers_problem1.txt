There is absolutely no difference between both the top levels of the pyramids, due to the fact that it's literally the same image, and this comes from the definition we saw in class and the slides. And that is because to have a laplacian you need to find the difference between the upsammpled G+1 and G. If we are at the bottom, there is nothing to upsample.
We decided on 1.2 and 1.1 because if we started to use bigger coefficients then the image started to darken too much, it did sharpen but it eventually became worse. The two different factors were due to the fact that a higher coefficient on the last feature makes more pronunciated changes, thus a more restrained coefficient helps a bunch.
